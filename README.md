# Algorithm_Training
Sometimes the best way to learn an algorithm is to build it yourself.  I created this repo as a collection of various algorithms that I am attempting to derive. I don't expect the algorithms to have all the assumptions or hyperparameters accounted for, rather just a skeleton where I can run a really basic training on. 

Due to simplicity and space constraints, I will be using the following data set from Kaggle on Bike Share Trips in Austin, TX as my main testing example.  I chose this dataset since I should be able to perform most types of supervised/unsupervised algorithms. 

1. Time Series - ARIMA
